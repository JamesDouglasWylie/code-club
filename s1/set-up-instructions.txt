1. Download Anaconda 

 Full version -> https://www.continuum.io/downloads
 Mini version -> http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

 The first version takes 3.3GB of space, the second one is much lighter but you'll have to manually install things. In any case, choose **python 2.7** and make sure you say **yes** to *"Add Anaconda to system path"*.

2. Install libraries

 Once the installation of Anaconda is complete, open a command prompt (terminal in mac), type in `conda install `and the library name. Hit enter/return. 
 
 If you can't find your terminal/command promt, use your search bar. You must have one!
 
 The libraries we'll need are:
    	
	* ipython
	* numpy
    	* scipy
    	* sympy
    	* pandas
    	* matplotlib
    	* seaborn (if you choose to install full Anaconda, just conda install this)

 If it gives you an error, I'll try to fix it in class.

3. Install a good text editor (not necessary but highly recommended) 

 This is a must for anyone doing programming. I like Sublime 3.0 (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), but there are a few. 
 
 Choose one with text highliting!

4. Set up GitHub

 Create an account in https://github.com/

 Download the desktop app from https://desktop.github.com/ 

 Don't pay too much attention to the github tutorials, I'll teach you how to use it in the first session. 

5. Download the materials (optional): 

 Go to the course github (https://github.com/crisla/code-club) and click on "fork". 

 Open your desktop GitHub (the program you just downloaded), log in and click on the plus sign. 

 Choose "clone" => "code-club" (NOT "crisla/code-club"!) => "clone code-club" and choose a place in your comptuer. 

Now you can find that folder in your computer and look at all the content!

To open this (or any other notebook) open the command prompt/terminal and navigate to the folder where the notebook is by typing `cd folder-path`. So for example, if it is in you documents, type `cd Documents/folder`.

Once there, type in `ipython notebook`. Your internet browser should open. Give it some time.
